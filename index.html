        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! Thank you for visiting my site and taking a moment to learn more about me! I was born in the smallest state in the United States on a chilly winter morning sometime in the late 1980s. I currently work for Amazon as a DOT Certified Driver Trainer and have been an Amazonian for nearly 4 years. I formerly worked as a customer service representative for Amazon, and also have several years of customer service experience with other companies before boarding the Amazon ship. I also interned as a radio DJ at a classic hits station in my home state of Rhode Island when I was 19; it was the career path I wanted to follow at the time, but it never worked out for me due to job cuts in the industry. However, I feel the skills I acquired during that time have been and will continue to be beneficial in my future endeavors.</p>

          <p>I am currently pursuing a Software Development Certification with Correlation One. I am passionate about technology and have loved playing with computers ever since my family acquired our first PC with Windows 3.1 in the 90s! Technology has certainly come a long way since then. I hope to break into the tech industry once I earn my certification with Correlation One, ideally within AWS or another sector of Amazon, but I am definitely open to opportunites with other companies as well. My ideal locations to relocate to would be Toronto, Ontario or Montreal, Quebec, Canada and hopefully a career in software development will take me to one of these locations.</p>
